Package writ implements option decoding with GNU getopt_long conventions.
All long and short-form option variations are supported: --with-x, --name Sam,
--day=Friday, -i FILE, -vvv, etc.

Basics

Writ uses the Command and Option types to represent available options and
subcommands.  Input arguments are decoded with Command.Decode().

For convenience, the New() function can parse an input struct into a
Command with Options that represent the input struct's fields.  It uses
struct field tags to control the behavior.  The resulting Command's Decode()
method updates the struct's fields in-place when option arguments are decoded.

Alternatively, Commands and Options may be created directly.  All fields on
these types are exported.

Options

Options are specified via the "option" and "flag" struct tags.  Both represent
options, but fields marked "option" take arguments, whereas fields marked
"flag" do not.

Every Option must have an OptionDecoder.  Writ provides decoders for most
basic types, as well as some convenience types.  See the NewOptionDecoder()
function docs for details.

Commands

New() parses an input struct to build a top-level  Command.  Subcommands are
supported by using the "command" field tag.  Fields marked with "command" must
be of struct type, and are parsed the same way as top-level commands.

Help Output

Writ provides methods for generating help output.  Command.WriteHelp()
generates help content and writes to a given io.Writer.  Command.ExitHelp()
writes help content to stdout or stderr and terminates the program.

Writ uses a template to generate the help content.  The default template
mimics --help output for common GNU programs.  See the documentation of the
Help type for more details.

Field Tag Reference

The New() function recognizes the following combinations of field tags:

	Option Fields:
		- option (required): a comma-separated list of names for the option
		- description: the description to display for help output
		- placeholder: the placeholder value to use next to the option names (e.g. FILE)
		- default: the default value for the field
		- env: the name of an environment variable, the value of which is used as a default for the field

	Flag fields:
		- flag (required): a comma-separated list of names for the flag
		- description: the description to display for help output

	Command fields:
		- name (required): a name for the command
		- aliases: a comma-separated list of alias names for the command
		- description: the description to display for help output

If both "default" and "env" are specified for an option field, the environment
variable is consulted first.  If the environment variable is present and
decodes without error, that value is used.  Otherwise, the value for the
"default" tag is used.  Values specified via parsed arguments take precedence
over both types of defaults.
